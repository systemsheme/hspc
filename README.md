### Abstract: 
> Hematopoietic multipotent progenitors (MPPs) regulate blood cell production to appropriately
meet the biological demands of the human body. Human MPPs remain ill-defined whereas mouse MPPs have been well characterized with distinct immunophenotypes and lineage potencies. Using multiomic single cell analyses and complementary functional assays, we identified new human MPPs and oligopotent progenitor populations within Lin-CD34+CD38dim/lo adult bone marrow with distinct biomolecular and functional properties. These populations were prospectively isolated based on expression of CD69, CLL1, and CD2 in addition to classical markers like CD90 and CD45RA. We show that within the canonical Lin-CD34+CD38dim/loCD90-CD45RA- MPP population, there is a CD69+ MPP with long-term engraftment and multilineage differentiation potential, a CLL1+ myeloid-biased MPP, and a CLL1-CD69- erythroid-biased MPP. We also show that the canonical Lin-CD34+CD38dim/loCD90-CD45RA+ LMPP population can be separated into a CD2+ LMPP with lymphoid and myeloid potential, a CD2- LMPP with high lymphoid potential, and a CLL1+ GMP with minimal lymphoid potential. We used these new HSPC profiles to study human and mouse bone marrow cells and observe limited cell type specific homology between humans and mice and cell type specific changes associated with aging. By identifying and functionally characterizing new adult MPP sub-populations, we provide an updated framework for future studies in human hematopoiesis.

### Key Points: 
MPPs are ill defined, as functionally distinct human MPPs akin to those in mouse hematopoiesis have yet to be identified. Over the past few years, several studies have utilized single cell methods for studying hematopoiesis, however, rigorous isolation and functional characterization of distinct MPPs in human adults has yet to be accomplished. This limitation impairs the ability to study adult blood disorders and accurately interpret results derived from the mouse model. Here, we performed a systematic evaluation of primary adult human bone marrow cells using single cell methods and complimentary functional assays to identify molecularly and functionally distinct progenitors. As a result, we identify new adult human MPPs and oligopotent progenitors (OPPs) and show the potential benefits of using this framework for future studies.

> We provide specific immunophenotypes for newly defined MPPs and OPPs in adult human hematopoiesis, and a new sorting strategy for the isolation and study of these important cells.
> We present a rigorous framework for using multiomic, multi-platform, and multi-species single cell technologies in the study of hematopoiesis. As a result, we provide an extended biomolecular characterization of these new HSPCs and a framework for utilizing this reference in future research that can be applied across organ systems.
> We show how adult MPPs and OPPs are molecularly distinct from human cord blood and have limited homology with mouse HSPCs.
> We identify accurate HSPC specific gene signatures that are associated with human aging.

**Data Access:** The raw data for the newly generated single cell data will be deposited in dbGaP under accession phs003690.v1.p1 and the processed UMI tables are available under GEO accession GSE262440.
